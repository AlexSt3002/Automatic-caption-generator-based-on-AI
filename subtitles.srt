00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:19,500
One confidential evening, not three months ago, Lionel Wallace told me this story of

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,140
the door in the wall, and at the time I thought that so far as he was concerned it was a true

6
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:29,699
story. He told it me with such a direct simplicity of conviction that I could not do otherwise

7
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:36,439
than believe in him. But in the morning, in my own flat, I woke to a different atmosphere.

8
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:42,460
And as I lay in bed and recalled the things he had told me, stripped of the glamour of

9
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:48,579
his earnest, slow voice, denuded of the focused shaded table light, the shadowy atmosphere

10
00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:53,960
that wrapped about him and the pleasant bright things, the dessert and glasses and napery

11
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:58,920
of the dinner we had shared, making them for the time a bright little world quite cut off

12
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,079
from everyday realities.
